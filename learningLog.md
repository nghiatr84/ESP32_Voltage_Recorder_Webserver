# Retrieving Triboelectric Device Voltage Level
## Project Learning Log
### After the project, I have:
- Furthered my understanding in developing embedded device using ESP32 microcontroller,
- Furthered my understanding in developing web server using ESP32 microcontroller,
- Learned to send requests to web server using HTML and JavaScript,
- Learned to visualise data as graphs using JavaScript,
- Learned the basic concepts of triboelectricity.
I can use the knowledge I have gathered from this project to help me on my academic journey and
career in the fields of embedded systems, programming, back-end and front-end web development, and
smart wearables.
### The challenges I faced making this device include:
- How to enhance the deviceâ€™s responsiveness. This entirely depends on how fast we would want
the device to store and discharge the energy. Hence, changing the capacitor would make sense
in this case.
- Making the voltage small enough so the microcontroller can read, while maintaining the current.
Because the current is so small, a decent voltage divider will dissipate all the current into heat.
Using smaller resistance resistors is also not an option since it will cause a short circuit. The
solution I have come up with is to use only one resistor so that the voltage drops but the current
went through enough for the ADC of ESP32 to read. I have tried a lot of resistors and recheck the
read voltage from ESP32 with a multi-meter to ensure the accuracy of the voltage being
recorded.
- ADC2 pins of an ESP32 would not work with Wi-Fi turned on, and I must switch to ADC1 pins
instead. This is mentioned in the documentation of the ESP32; however, it took me a lot of time
to find out the problem.
- Making the web server and the web client was a challenge themselves. I consulted internet
forums extensively and spent a lot of time figuring out, but eventually managed to finish it.
